Core Perl Documentation Formatted for your PalmPilot!

'Finally, you can have perl on your Palm!'

'An indispensable reference!'

created with:
    pod2html 
    and
    htmltodoc from the palm-doctoolkit
    pyrite (some Python scripts for dealing with PalmOS 'stuff') 

Converted by:
    Robert Spier <rspier@cpan.org>
    
PalmPerlDoc comes in two formats:
    'doc'  -> standard Palm doc format
    'teal' -> fancier tealdoc format with links and fonts

The entire core documentation requires about 1.7 MB of disk space.  
Space in your palm will vary.

ChangeLog:
    Aug 06 1999 -> first release to CPAN
    Dec 05 2000 -> upload of beta perl 5.7.0@8006 pods
